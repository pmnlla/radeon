The best I can do for a hotend design is to use an off the shelf part. There are several options:

- Anycubic Kobra/Vyper hotends: I've got plenty of experience with these, they're insanely cheap, and easy to mount. However, they have such horrible flow rates that there's no point in using one with CoreXY kinematics.
- Elegoo Neptune 4 hotend: Disappointing at best, but super easy to work with.
- Bambu P1/X1 series hotend: also very easy to work with, has a very compact footprint, and very high flow. A little more difficult to mount, and the heatbreak fan is one hell of an obstacle. Also has a stupid proprietary connector that I CBA to reverse engineer. However, I can find them plentifully on AliExpress for around CA$15 per unit.
